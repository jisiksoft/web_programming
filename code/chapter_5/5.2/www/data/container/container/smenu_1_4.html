<div class="big color5">How-to Series</div>
- JISIKSOFT makes the programming books “How-to Series” every year.
  "How-to Series" is books showing how to build up software having subjects step by step.
  It shows many steps individually at the beginning, and readers will
  understand the whole and get many knowledge at the last.<br><br>
<div class="big color5">Technology is Transferred through Books.</div>
- The best sellers in programming books are primer books. But, interesting is that
  only primer books are sold well, and selling of other books is not good.
  The problem is that it is hard to make software program only after reading 
  the primer books intensively. The slogan of JISIKSOFT is only one.
  "Just Start after Deciding Program you Want to Make." If reading a primer book,
  he should start making his own program. The way to make program is to make it 
  step by step by finding what he needs one by one. JISIKSOFT is transferring
  programming skills by publishing books that are the next step of primer books.<br><br>
<div class="big color5">Educates to as Many People as Possible</div>
- The second book of JISIKSOFT is made for readers to buy as many as possible.
  (The general manger "SEHOON KIM" maybe gets greedy about money.)
  However... the book has been sold steadily and many readers have asked some questions...
  JISIKSOFT recognizes that many people knowing few programming knowledge buy the book
  and try to make software program. After that, the viewpoint of JISIKSOFT 
  about publishing is changed. That is to make books having subject that people
  are interested in. As times change, many jobs will be created and disappeared.
  But, the age of the computer never disappear, so programmers giving the power
  to the computer will be forever. In addition, they will be able to work until getting dementia.
  Software programmer will be a good job because the average life expectancy
  is getting long.<br><br><br>
<div class="color1">* The general manager "SEHOON KIM" had always worked 
at a company and only slept at home... but, he changed the way of his life 
at the beginning of 2010. "I will enjoy my life."^^ He has written short 
essays every day for 5 years in learning and enjoying what he wants.
After that, he had written a book... it was possible to publish it after
an editor of the publishing company "Hanbit Media" edited every thing.</div>
