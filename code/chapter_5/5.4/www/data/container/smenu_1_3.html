<div class="big bold color1">Programming Education</div>
<br><br>
<div class="big color5">Educates New Technology gotten from Developing</div>
- JISIKSOFT always develops new software and uses the latest technology.
  JISIKSOFT transfers some useful technologies gotten from developing by educating.
  Of course, the core technology of customers and harmful technology to society (ex: malware)
  are never shared.<br><br>
<div class="big color5">Makes the Future Programmers Grow</div>
- It is impossible to get software programming skill in short time, and 
  programmers always have to study to get the current technology.
  Even if there are many programmers, only some people having high-level skills 
  lift up their head. Beginners should study to get excellent
  skills over 10 years for their future. JISIKSOFT does the best for 
  them who are the treasure of the future. The power of JISIKSOFT is now small,
  however many small powers will make the world beautiful together.<br><br>
<div class="big color5">Computer is the Lab of Mathematics</div>
- Mathematicians have made computer. Many people think that mathematics needs only 
  a pen and papers to prove theories, but JISIKSOFT emphasizes that a computer is
  the good laboratory of math. It can be possible for a computer to show if 
  the proof of math is correct. Of course, programming never show everything,
  but JISIKSOFT will do the best to show many things are possible.
  Pure Math has made the current, and Applied Math using a computer will build up the future.
  A genius makes theory... and JISIKSOFT will make an experiment.
  After that, the knowledge of JISIKSOFT will be shared by educating<br><br><br>
<div class="color1">* The general manager "SEHOON KIM" is a 
ordinary man never getting scholarship in Mathematics. In addition,
he does not know the root formula in middle school because of his bad memory.
However, he thinks that logical thinking is the quality of a good programmer.
A person having heavy hips can do math and programming well.^^
Maybe, Hips are more important than a head.</div>
