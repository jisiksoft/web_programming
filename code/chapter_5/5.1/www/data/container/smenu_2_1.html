<div class="big bold color1">The Number of Staffs is One.</div>
<br><br>
There is only one member in JISIKSOFT.<br>
He is a general manager working as a staff.<br>
But... fortunately, the general manager decides everything in the company.<br>
Works as a Staff... General Manager on a business card... decides as a CEO... (one man company^^)<br>
It is not possible for a man to process the whole in a company.<br>
For example, he works with a designer out of JISIKSOFT for stylish design.<br>
He solves problems as a professional man in thinking what is the best for customers.<br>
JISIKSOFT goes forward step by step to develop software technology.<br>
Society having many one-man companies is strong even if looks small.<br>
...Because it has much stronger ownership.<br>
Quietly... Smartly... Energetically... JISIKSOFT advances.<br>
